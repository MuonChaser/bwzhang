Place your real images in this folder to replace the placeholders:

- your_photo.svg  (or your_photo.jpg/png) — main profile photo used in the page
- logo1.svg       (or logo1.jpg/png) — institution logo used in the header

If you add JPG/PNG files, keep the same filenames (your_photo.jpg, logo1.jpg) or update the `src` in `static/personal/index.html` accordingly.
